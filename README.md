# viz-manga-jujutsu-kaisen
 Proof of concept for a GitHub Actions datastore for Jujutsu Kaisen manga.


It uses [Viz Manga](https://github.com/minormending/viz-manga) to find and fetch the latest chapters and GitHub Actions to save them to this repository. See: [Actions](.github/workflows/fetch-manga.yml)
